# Database Configuration for SequencesDB Bioinformatics Application
# =============================================================================
#
# This configuration file contains database connection parameters for the
# SequencesDB application. It defines how the application connects to the
# MySQL/MariaDB database that stores sequence library metadata.
#
# SECURITY WARNING:
# This file contains sensitive credentials and should NEVER be committed
# to version control. The password should be changed from the default
# before production deployment.
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
# 1. Change the default password to a secure value
# 2. Create a dedicated database user with minimal privileges
# 3. Consider using environment variables for sensitive values
# 4. Ensure file permissions are restrictive (600 or 640)
# 5. Use database connection pooling for better performance
#
# DATABASE SCHEMA:
# The 'sequences_dtb' database should contain the following tables:
# - Library: Main library records with metadata
# - File: File records linked to libraries
# - Organism, Tissue, Cell, Experiment, Background, Method, Antibody, Sequencer
# - Read_Type: Paired-end read relationships
#
# BACKUP CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Regular database backups are essential
# - Consider transaction log backups for point-in-time recovery
# - Test restore procedures regularly
#
# MONITORING:
# - Monitor database performance and connection usage
# - Set up alerts for connection failures
# - Track database growth and plan for scaling
